# snake-game
A Scala project that implements the classic snake game
We are experimenting to port the game onto Indigo, which is a pixel art Scala 2D game engine that encourages functional programming, and broadly follows the Elm architecture. To play the game, run the following command from your terminal in the repo root:
`mill snakeIn5Minutes.runGame`
